## Our Story: Who We Are & Why We Exist

### Who We Are
Cafe Nogales is a coffee sourcing company built on proximity— to producers, to origin, and to purpose.
Founded in Korea, grounded in Colombia, we introduced a new standard of traceable, high-quality green coffee to Korean roasters. Today, we continue to grow—reaching new origins and new generations, without compromising the values that built us.
A company rooted in origin, built on trust, and driven by quality.

### What Defines Us

#### Pioneering Spirit
First to introduce single-farm Colombian microlots to Korea

#### Integrity at Origin
Transparent, traceable sourcing with long-term producer relationships

#### Coffee as Culture 
We connect stories, people, and cups

#### Roaster-First Thinking
Our partners are not customers; they’re collaborators


## Mission & Vision

### Our Mission
We search. We taste. We listen.
Not just to find rare coffees—
but to build real connections between roasters and the people behind the coffee.
We go where the coffee starts.
We stay close to the producers who grow it.
We select with purpose, share with care, and speak with honesty—
so that every coffee we source carries meaning.

### Our Goal - Closer
To be Asia’s most trusted and respected curator of green coffee—starting with Colombia, 
expanding to the world—while staying closer to origin, and closer to the people who roast.
How?
By going Closer to Origin
By being Closer to Our Clients


## Strategic Definitions

### Closer as a call to Action

#### Trust
“Asia’s most trusted” means we are the sourcing company roasters rely on when the stakes are high.
Internally, this means:
Respect Proximity
+ We never overpromise—on flavor, availability, or logistics.
+ Our cupping notes are accurate. Our scores are real.
+ We offer transparency on price, producer relationship, and process.
+ We help roasters succeed—even when it doesn’t benefit us directly.
Trust is earned every time we answer honestly, show up consis- tently, and let quality speak first.

#### Respect
“Respected” doesn’t mean recognition—it means mutual regard. With producers. With roasters. With each other.
Internally, this means:
+ We treat producers as partners, not suppliers.
+ We pay attention to their context: harvest realities, climate, cost of production.
+ We value roasters’ time, needs, and feedback—especially small and emerging ones.
+ We give credit where it’s due: in stories, labels, and conversa- tions.
Respect isn’t something we claim. It’s something we practice—by being clear, fair, and human.

#### Proximity
“Closer to origin” is more than a slogan—it’s the way we work.
Internally, this means:
+ We don’t just buy coffee; we go to farms, cup with producers, and understand what they need.
+ We don’t just upload lots to a web store; we guide roasters through them, origin by origin.
+ We stay close to every link in the chain, so we can respond quickly, explain clearly, and source more meaningfully.
Being closer lets us source better coffee, solve problems faster, and build relationships that last.
