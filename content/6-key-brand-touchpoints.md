# 6. Key Brand Touchpoints

## B2B Website Layout Guidelines
(Homepage hero → current origins → catalog → sourcing story. Keep copy short, precise, traceable.)

## Green Coffee Bag Design (tier variations)
(What elements are fixed vs variable; how tiers/origins are distinguished.)

## Roaster Welcome Kit
(Onboarding pack: brand story, how to read our offer sheet, logistics terms, contact points.)

## Cupping Cards & Traceability Sheets
(Standardized info: origin, producer, process, elevation, harvesting, scoring, notes.)

## Social Media Brand Experience
(Consistency of tone/visuals with the voice framework; what to avoid.)

## Event / Pop-up Signage System
(Banners, table talkers, cupping event cards — proportion of photo vs text.)
